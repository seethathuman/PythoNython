# PythoNython
work-in-progress python 3 interpereter written in python 2.7

## Usage
to use, run `python ./PythoNython.py` followed by the file to interperet.

## Why?
- Efficiency
  - By being written in an older version of python, the python 2.7 interpereter has less features and thus less bloated with useless features than python 3 and is therefore faster.

- Compatibility
  - Being written in python, this allows python code to be run anywhere that supports Python, increasing compatibility with python.
  
...also, cause why not?
